# CampusConnect - University Social Platform

## Project Overview
CampusConnect is a web-based social platform designed exclusively for university students. It aims to promote communication, collaboration, and networking within the university community. The platform allows students to create profiles, connect with peers, share updates, join interest-based groups, and stay informed about campus events and academic discussions.

## Features
### User Registration and Authentication

- Personalized profiles stored locally.

### Profile Management
- Users can add profile pictures, bios, and academic interests.

### News Feed & Posts
- A timeline where users can post updates, images, and links stored in the browser.

### Messaging System
- Private and group chat functionality using local storage.

### Groups & Forums
- Interest-based communities for discussions and collaborations.

### Events & Announcements
- A section for campus-related events and notifications stored locally.

### Privacy & Security
- Basic user verification and content moderation through front-end validation.

## Components of the Website
1. **Homepage:** Displays trending posts, upcoming events, and featured groups.
2. **User Profile Page:** Contains user information, posts, and activity history.
3. **News Feed:** Shows latest posts from connections and groups.
4. **Messaging Panel:** Enables real-time private and group chats.

7. **Settings Page:** Provides account customization options like privacy controls and notification preferences.
8. **Admin Dashboard:** Enables moderators to manage content and user interactions.

## Design Considerations
1. **User Experience (UX):** The platform should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and visually appealing to ensure students find it engaging.
2. **Accessibility:** Ensure the website is accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, by following WCAG guidelines.
3. **Responsiveness:** The design must be mobile-friendly and optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
4. **Performance Optimization:** Use efficient coding practices and lightweight assets to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.
5. **Scalability:** The design should allow for future enhancements, such as backend integration if needed later.
6. **User Engagement:** Encourage student participation with interactive features like polls, comments, and reactions.
